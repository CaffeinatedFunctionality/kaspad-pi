# Kaspa Node on Raspberry Pi

This guide provides steps to set up a Kaspa node on a Raspberry Pi using Rust or you could just use the image created that already has this done for you. 
For 1 BPS an SD Card will work just fine, however you will want a Solid State Drive(SSD) when we move to 10 BPS 

If you found this helpful, buy me a coffee, but really I won't use it for that since I'm saving up for a mining rig to help the network more!

```

Because this file is so large I have to host it myself instead of making a release which was my original intention, so I'm paying for Google Drive to host it.

All links outside of the google drive link hosting the pi image are affiliate links. This doesn't cost you, but it does help me, but if you don't want to use them it's ok!

## Clone setup

### Step 1: Download kaspad-pi.img

https://drive.google.com/file/d/11zEqknho4Yo_y5miBEjM2FP9poAQRLAr/view?usp=sharing

### Step 2: Download Balena Etcher

https://etcher.balena.io/

### Step 3: Install kaspad-pi.img onto the drive you want for the pi

1. **Plug in the ssd or sdcard**
2. **Open Balena Etcher**
3. **Select kaspad-pi.image**
4. **Select your drive**
5. **Hit flash**

## Manual setup

### Step 1: Set Up Your Raspberry Pi

1. **Install Raspberry Pi OS**
   Download and install the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS from the [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/).

2. **Update Your System**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

### Step 2: Install Rust

1. **Install Rust**
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. **Configure Rust**
   ```bash
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

1. **Install general prerequisites**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install curl git build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config 
    ```

2. **Install Protobuf (required for gRPC)**
  
    ```bash
    sudo apt install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev #Required for gRPC
    ```
3. **Install the clang toolchain (required for RocksDB and WASM secp256k1 builds)**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install clang-format clang-tidy \
    clang-tools clang clangd libc++-dev \
    libc++1 libc++abi-dev libc++abi1 \
    libclang-dev libclang1 liblldb-dev \
    libllvm-ocaml-dev libomp-dev libomp5 \
    lld lldb llvm-dev llvm-runtime \
    llvm python3-clang
    ```
4. **Install wasm-pack**
    ```bash
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```
5. **Install wasm32 target**
    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

6. **Install pm2**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm
    sudo npm install pm2 -g
    ```

### Step 4: Clone the Kaspa Node Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa.git
   ```

### Step 5: Create a startup file

1. **Create the script that starts kaspad**
   ```bash
   nano ~/startup_script.sh
   ```

2. **Add the following content to the script**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  cd ~/rusty-kaspa
  cargo run --release --bin kaspad
  ```

3. **Make the script executable**
  ```bash
  chmod +x ~/startup_script.sh
  ```

### Step 6: Configure pm2

1. **Start the script with pm2**
   ```bash
   pm2 start ~/startup_script.sh --name kaspad
   ```

2. **Setup pm2 to run on startup**
   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   ```
   The command will output something like the following
   ```bash
   [PM2] Init System found: systemd
   [PM2] To setup the Startup Script, copy/paste the following command:
   sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin pm2 startup systemd -u pi --hp /home/pi
   ```

3. **Copy and run the command provided by pm2**

4. **Save the pm2 process list**
   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

5. **Reboot the raspberry pi**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

### Step 7: Monitor and Maintain

1. **Check the pm2 process**
   ```bash
   pm2 status
   ```
   You should see the 'kaspad' process running

2. **View the logs**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs kaspad
   ```
   This should show you that it's running properly and you should see

### Optional: Create an update script(unnecessary, however ideal so you don't miss a step with pm2) 

1. **Create the script that updates kaspad**
   ```bash
   nano ~/update_kaspad.sh
   ```

2. **Add the following content to the script**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  pm2 stop kaspad
  cd ~/rusty-kaspa
  git pull
  pm2 start kaspad
  ```

3. **Make the script executable**
  ```bash
  chmod +x ~/update_kaspad.sh
  ```

3. **Test the script**
  ```bash
  cd ~/
  ./update_kaspad.sh
  ```
  It should show pm2 stopping, the repo updating, and then the pm2 starting again

## Additional Tips

- **Optimize Performance**: Monitor your Raspberry Piâ€™s performance, get a case with a fan, preferrably one that will allow you to use a SSD in the future as that is what will be needed for 10 blocks per second.
- **Join the Community**: Engage with the Kaspa community for support, updates, and best practices.

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Kaspa node running on your Raspberry Pi. If you encounter any issues, refer to the project documentation or community forums for assistance.
